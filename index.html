                <small> Song by Justin Bieber</small>
                <p>
                    Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
                    <br />
                    To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
                    <br />
                    Would you capture it or just let it slip?
                    <br />
                    Yo
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    You better lose yourself in the music
                    <br />
                    The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
                    <br />
                    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
                    <br />
                    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yoMy faith is shaken
                    <br />
                    You better
                 </p>   
                <p>
                    Always gonna be another mountain
                    <br />
                    Always gonna wanna make it move
                    <br />
                    Always gonna be an uphill battle
                    <br />
                    Ain't about how fast I get there
                    <br />
                    Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
                    <br />
                    Yeah, ooh, yeah
                    <br />
                    It's the climb
                </p>    
                <p>
                    And I didn't wanna write a song cause 
                    <br />
                    I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
                    <br />
                    I don't but, you still hit my phone up

                    And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
                    <br />
                    I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
                    <br />
                    My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
                    <br />
                    And I never like to admit that I was wrong
                    <br />
